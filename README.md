# Chirologia, by John Bulwer, 1644
This is intended to be a web typographic experiment on John Bulwer's 1644 Chirologia. It won't be comprehensive — it's much too long — and it won't be typographically perfect — while there are good typographic candidates in the

nothing looks like four-hundred-year-old typography.

So, as of this writing, it will try to take advantage of layout, typographic, and, most importantly/frustratingly, letterform consistencies. I'll likely introduce color into the design as I try to replicate an original seventeenth-century work.

This work by Bulwer (in connection with Juan Pablo Bonet's 1620 renderings of manual alphabet handshapes [Reducción de las letras y arte para ensenar a hablar los neudos ("Summary of the letters and the art of teaching speech to the mute")]) is personal to me in my other work as a researcher of deaf studies and the visual representation of signed languages.
